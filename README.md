Magnetic card reader swipe-in system

## Description
A swipe-in system designed for keeping track of employee hours. There are two different programs to run. The first is for setting up the system and adding admin users. The second is for user account creation, checking in or out, exporting logs, or deleting user accounts. 

* Each time an account is created, the user or admin will be emailed account details
* Each check-in or out will be followed by a confirmation email
* Only Admins can export logs, which sends an email to the connected account email with previous logs of login and logout times
